        We will divide the individual letters into three zones to
        better understand how the writer makes specific use of
        their</span> <span style=

        and the</span> <span style=

        physical elements in their environment</span> <span style=

        <br />
        &nbsp;
        <br />
        In the English alphabet, which is also used for most
        European languages, including French, German and Italian, a
        part of every letter is found in the middle zone. The upper
        zone has six bizonal letters: b, d, h, k, 1 and t. The
        lower zone has six bizonal letters: g,</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;">j,
        p, q,</span> <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;">y
        and z. The middle zone has thirteen single zone letters,
        the five vowels, a. e, i, o, u, plus c, m,</span>
        <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;">n,
        r, s, v, w and x. The letter "f" is the only trizonal
        letter in the alphabet.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wherever you find extra emphasis of size, embellishment,
        width, simplicity, force or meagerness, this is the zone
        the writer is expressing most strongly at that moment of
        writing. This is why we need more than one sample of
        writing for a full, in-depth analysis; it eliminates a
        "mood-of-the-moment" interpretation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Examples and what to look for are in the Handwriting
        Insights deck. &nbsp;</span><span style=

        </span><span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;">In
        American schools, writing is usually first learned by using
        the manuscript printed form. As the writer matures he
        learns the more sophisticated method of joining letter
        forms called cursive writing. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        The four most common connective forms are garlands,
        arcades, angles and thread. You will learn to recognize
        each type of form and how to interpret its use within the
        writing. None of us uses one connective exclusively. One
        form usually dominates and an another is secondary. The
        other two forms of connectives may also be present to a
        lesser degree. Combinations of writing form reveal the
        personality in each writing, but only in part. You still
        must take into consideration the arrangement of the writing
        and the symbolism of margins, zones, spacing and slant.
        &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;"><u>GARLANDS</u></span><span style="font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">:</span>
        <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;">The
        most common form of connective between letters is the cup
        shape of the garland, curved at the bottom and open at the
        top. It can be found in all three zones, between letters,
        within letters, even at the beginnings and endings of
        words.
        <br />
        The garland is a soft, easily stroked connective depicting
        the writer who is receptive, compliant and easy going. He
        may be warm and sympathetic, empathetic and sentimental. He
        is open and responsive to the people and the environment
        around him. The writer who uses many garlands is often said
        to be "people oriented". He feels before he thinks.
        <br />

        </span><span style=

        <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;">The
        arcade, or inverted garland, is shaped like an arch, curved
        on top and open at the bottom. M's, n,s and h's are the
        most obvious arcade formations in the alphabet. You may
        also find arcades between letters especially in the
        connection between o, v and w and the letter which follows
        them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Usually mixed with other connectives, the arcade is used by
        the creative personality. This writer is a constructive
        thinker, one who deliberates before making up his mind. He
        may use this slow and deliberate action as a form of
        cautious contrcl and self protection. There is a certain
        dignity and formality in the writer who uses arcades to a
        dominant degree.</span><span style=

        <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;">The
        speed and energy used by many writers often produces abrupt
        changes of direction which create an angle at the baseline
        and sometimes at the top of the letter. This sudden change
        of direction must also make a pause before the writing can
        proceed. An angle interrupts smooth flow of thought and
        action, and an abrupt manner is often the result. The
        writer who habitually uses angles is often analytical,
        tense and self disciplined. He usually can see more than
        one approach to a problem and therefore often has some
        degree of executive ability. He uses will power to direct
        and control his actions.

        <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;">Thread
        is the least used of the connectives, and sometimes is the
        hardest to recognize. There are three general types of
        thread. &nbsp;
        <br />
        &nbsp; A. THE THINNING OF THE STROKE ITSELF. You may need
        to use your magnifying glass to be sure you are looking at
        thread. It looks like a piece of thread that has been
        broken rather than cut cleanly. It "feathers" out with
        lessening pressure of the pen. Look for it between letters
        at the end of a word, and especially in i dots and t
        crosses that are made with speed.
        <br />
        Interpretation of Type 1 Thread indicates a writer who is
        in too much of a hurry to do a precise bit of work. He may
        complete the essentials of a job, but he evades
        responsibility by neglecting the finishing details. He
        loses interest quickly and goes on to the next thing.
        Impatience is a part of this writer's
        personality.</span><span style=

        THE DIMINISHING SIZE OF LETTERS WITHIN A
        WORD</span><span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;">.
        As Type I thins out the individual stroke, Type 2 thins
        down the letters in a word. When a whole word or part of a
        word "threads" the first letters are larger than each
        successive letter, and MZ size progressively diminishes in
        a regular pattern.
        <br />
        This type of thread is associated with a diplomatic
        personali-ty, one who is capable of seeing the whole, broad
        picture of a situation. He elects to lessen the force of
        his personality as he evaluates the situation, and he uses
        tact and diplomacy to do so. He may even point out a
        different direction of thinking as his method of evading
        the present crisis. &nbsp;

        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;">This
        third type looks like a spool of unraveled thread. You can
        see the undulations of the strand as it frees itself. This
        is a quick, fluid motion of writing combining alternate
        garl.and and arcade formations. It can be found in al 1
        three zones but is most apparent in the MZ. Paul uses it in
        the MZ and UZ.
        <br />
        Interpretation of Type 3 Thread shows a real evasion
        expert. The sinuous strokes of his pen are as devious as
        the snake that slithers around obstacles. This writer
        seldom faces an issue, but rather misdirects or eludes the
        reality with clever language, slight of hand or a downright
        refusal to face facts.</span><span style=

        can best be seen in letters containing upper loops: the b,
        d, h, 1, k, and t. The more the letter slant leans toward
        the right, the more emotional response can be

        people write with a slight right slant (B). This shows a
        willingness to comply with company rules, an ability to get
        along with co-workers, and put up with the boss's
        idiosyncracies. Writers with an extreme right slant can
        function well on the job, but might become hysterical under
        sudden emotional stress. Extreme left-slanted writers are
        sometimes antisocial, non-communicative, even defiant at
        times.

        "uphill" reveals the applicant worthy of further
        Trait-match evaluation. He's optimistic, ambitious and
        cheerful. This is a good start, and, if the other traits
        bear up well under your scrutiny, a welcome addition to any
        office force or gang crew. Writing ''downhill" may be
        caused by a temporary depression, ill health, or physical
        fatigue. If this applicant has special skills necessary in
        your business, it would be wise to have him return on
        another day and obtain another sample of his writing. The
        first downslanted sample could be just a temporary
        discouragement from job-hunting. If the second sample has
        the same downslanted appearance, it is a warning of an
        ingrained pessimism which keeps this applicant on the
        job-seeking circuit.

        The writer of a firm, straight, even baseline controls his
        moods, allowing him to go directly toward his goals without
        getting side-tracked.
        <br />
        <br />
        While a very slight wave in the baseline is a common sign,
        an unusual up-and-down fluctuation identifies the moody
        individual. A ruler placed under the first and last letters
        in a line of writing is an excellent way to determine an
        uneven baseline. Be sure you need this person's talents
        desperately before hiring him. He may be a go-getter on his
        ''up" days, but if he's in a ''downer" mood, he probably
        won't even show up for work.

        Spacing</span><span style=
        "font:19px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#030303;"><br />

        <br />
        Spaces in writing are just as important to the Traitmatch
        analyst as the writing itself. Spaces are found around the
        whole page of writing (the margin); in the amount of room
        that the letters take up (the letter size); in the generous
        or compressed usage of space between letters, lines, and
        words. All offer many clues to detect the occupational
        personality. A general rule-of-thumb is that the way in
        which a person uses space when writing indicates his use of
        space in his work. Check the application form. How did the
        prospect use the spaces within the blanks, boxes, or
        fill-ins? If he crowded the
        <br />
        letters to the left, he's fearful of his future. If he
        pushed all the letters to the right, he's ambitious and
        eager for the job. If he couldn't contain his writing
        within the spaces provided, he's not a good judge of time
        and space.

        Every letter takes up space, too. Some letters extend into
        the upper area of the writing and are referred to as
        upper-zone letters: b, d, h, k, /, and t. The lower-zone
        letters are the g, j, p, q, y, and z. Most letters are
        found in the middle zone of writing. The size of the middle
        zone is the major factor considered in handwriting
        analysis. Almost all other signs are compared to it.
        <br />
        f is the only letter that reaches all three zones.
        <br />
        Large writing and small writing refers to the middle-zone
        size, and are both easy to spot. Most people's script falls
        somewhere in between, however. This ''average size" of
        writing is found in the sample of applicants who can fit
        into almost any kind of job situation for which they are
        qualified. Their uniqueness will be revealed in other
        writing features. Large writing indicates a person who will
        need plenty of space in which to operate. Don't try to put
        him behind a desk or in any small confining area.

        The upper zone of writing holds the philosophy of life. It
        contains the writer's thought patterns including his
        ability to utilize abstract thinking in his daily routine.
        Most people push their letters to a moderate height into
        the upper zone showing their ability to think clearly about
        practical things. This writer fits nicely into a job where
        concrete ideas are required, as long as they are not too

        The prospective employee's interest in physical activity is
        the primary interest of many companies. The lower-zone
        extensionsreflect the applicant's physical and sexual
        activity, as well as his concern for money and food. Large,
        full lower loops, especially when they extend far below the

        Spacing Between Words
        <br />
        Spacing between words should be about the same width as the
        middle-zone letters. If spacing is consistent, it adds to
        the possibility of the writer being consistent. It is a
        positive trait for any job.

        PRESSURE</span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />

        Pressure measures the degree of intensity the employee will
        put into his work as well as his physical vitality and
        stamina. For instance, poets, speakers, politicians and
        ministers often have heavier writing pressure because they
        put emotion into what they have to say. The type of pen
        used will have some effect on the pressure. The soft-tipped
        pen can conceal the light-pressured writer. The Traltmatch
        analyst can tell this by turning the paper over and running
        his fingers over the back of the writing surface. If you
        feel or see the embossing caused by pressure from the pen,
        you are assured that the writer was using a ball point, not
        a soft- tipped pen and the pressure is genuine.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pressure takes a certain amount of physical exertion, and
        the soft-tipped pen user enjoys the easy flow of ink over
        the page. Soft-tipped pens are a cop-out for physical
        labor. However, they are also used by artists and sensual
        people. Check with other Traitmatch signs to determine if
        the writer is lazy.

        SPEED</span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />

        Speed is found in the flow of the writing and indicates
        speed of thought, action and perception. Additionally,
        writing that has few or no beginning strokes shows the
        stripping away of unnecessary details contributing to the
        applicant's efficiency in getting the job done. Note the
        T-crosses. If the cross is longer on the right side of the
        stem than on the left side, the writer is hurrying to
        complete his simple task of crossing the t. 1-dots which
        fall to the right of the stem also indicate speed.

        CLARITY</span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />

        Clarity involves all of the basic factors of handwriting
        analysis
        <br />
        in a positive way. It's a good idea to keep in mind that
        when
        <br />
        clarity in a written sample is combined with-
        <br />
        <br />
        * A slight, right slant = interest in communicating with
        others;
        <br />
        * Medium size writing = willingness to contact others
        physically and mentally
        <br />
        *Balanced expansion = reaching out to become involved.
        <br />
        *Even margins = good sense of self-identity within the
        environment.
        <br />
        *Good spacing between letters = generosity of time, money
        energy.
        <br />
        *Good spacing between words = interest in social contacts.
        <br />
        *Good space between lines = ability to think clearly and
        separate ideas.
        <br />
        * Clear formation of letters = wish to impart information
        and consideration for others.
        <br />
        <br />
        Illegible writing, whether scribbled by a world-wise
        scientist or by your inexperienced job applicant, indicates
        the individual who doesn't have the time or inclination to
        communicate. Someone once mentioned that the less legible
        the writing, the more intelligent the writer. Ever since
        then, some people have hidden their laziness and
        inconsideration behind that remark.
        <br />
        One secretary complained, ''My boss is such a terrible
        writer I can hardly make out what he means. Last week he
        didn't read over a letter before he signed it and I had
        typed something all wrong. I got bawled out. I think it was
        his fault, don't you?''
        <br />
        You bet! But secretaries aren't the only ones who suffer.
        Ask your local pharmacist, for instance.
        <br />
        Illegible script is the curse of good communication, and
        writing is-first and foremost -communication.
        <br />
        Many bosses have an executive type of mind; sharp, alert,
        quick. But the employer who doesn't take the time or effort
        to make his written thoughts clear enough to be translated
        by a secretary or anyone else is both inconsiderate and
        lacking in common sense.
        <br />
        Speed is the prime offender. We think faster than our
        fingers can move. Unless control is exercised over both
        thoughts and fingers, the results are usually unreadable.
        <br />
        There are, however, other reasons for illegibility in
        handwriting. It may be caused by emotional stress or an
        illness resulting in muscular impairment or hysteria. Also,
        a dishonest person hides his intentions behind poor
        writing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Illegibility maybe caused by more serious reasons than
        speed or inconsideration. When the physical or mental
        vitality of a writer is impaired through the use of drugs
        or alcohol, illegible writing is often a result. The uneven
        baseline is usually the first clue, signaling the lack of
        motor control. Letters not clearly formed due to speed may
        occur in everywriting at anytime, but when a sequence of
        letters fails to make sense, there is more than speed or
        inconsistency at work. If this is repeated on a page or two
        of writing, drop that application in the round file. You
        don't need the problems that can be brought to your
        workplace by this kind of employee.
        <br />
        III health often shows up in illegible writing especially
        if the writing also has weak pressure. There just is not
        enough vitality there for the writer to get through a good
        day's work. However, we all have our off days. If all other
        factors are favorable, and you might like to have him on
        your work team, suggest he comeback another time to repeat
        his writing sample.

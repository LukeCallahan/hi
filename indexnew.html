            <p align="left"><font size="+1"><b>Welcome to my website! This is 
              a no-hype zone - and I will be as brief as I can. Handwriting Insights 
              will not make you a professional handwriting analyst. It is not 
              a book. It is not a course. It is a set of 64 cards, connected by 
              a rivet in one corner, which explain eleven different handwriting 
              traits. Each trait has three to ten variations. So for example, 
              the trait of Slant, which represents a person's emotional interactions, 
              has the following six variations: strong right, right, vertical, 
              left, strong left, and varied. On the front of each card is an example 
              of that particular variation, and a description of what to look 
              for in the writing. On the back of the card is both a brief and 
              a more detailed explanation of what that particular writing trait 
              means. These explanation are descriptive, not judgmental. This means 
              that people will get insight into what their handwriting is saying 
              about their personalities without getting their feeling hurt. Producing 
              an analysis is a simple as going through the deck, seeing which 
              of the variations most matches the writing for each of the eleven 
              traits, and sliding the matching card to the side. You wind up with 
              eleven cards, and when you turn the deck over, there is the analysis. 
              If you want a record of the analysis, you simply check of the appropriate 
              boxes on the Individual Insights Pad that comes with your kit.</b></font></p>
            <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">This unique way of doing a handwriting 
              analysis has been granted a U.S. Patent. This format offers several 
              advantages for the person who does not want to be bothered with 
              becoming a professional graphologist and who just want to have fun 
              with hand writing analysis and reap some of the benefits from it. 
              Here are some of the advantages that it provides.</font></b></p>
            
          <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">&#149; You don't need to remember 
            which traits to look at and what they mean. Instead, you just go through 
            the deck and slide the matching card to the side.</font></b></p>
            
          <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">&#149; When you are doing someone's 
            handwriting sample with them, you don't have to worry about how to 
            word things. You can simply select the cards and then just flip them 
            over and hand them to the person for them to read (I find that people 
            prefer this) or you can read the cards to them. </font></b></p>
            
          <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">&#149; People don't think that you 
            are just &quot;making up&quot; the analysis since it is right there 
            on the cards.</font></b></p>
            
          <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">&#149; Typically, as people are going 
            through the cards it gets them talking about what they do and don't 
            agree with. This is a really great way to learn more about someone 
            and how they see themselves. </font></b></p>
            
          <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">&#149; There are hundreds of traits 
            that professional graphologists look at to come up with a professional 
            analysis. Handwriting Insights gives you eleven traits that have been 
            proven over time to give a good basic analyis with a fraction of the 
            effort.</font></b></p>
            <p align="left"><b><font size="+1"> I wrote the free basic handwriting 
              analysis course so that you could easily learn to do a simple analysis 
              of hand writing. I integrated some of the graphics from my deck 
              to make it as easy as possible to learn, but it is harder to do 
              an analysis this way then to use the deck. I hope that it will give 
              you an idea of what the deck has to offer, and you will consider 
              a purchase. It was designed so that it would be ideal to use with 
              teens as a self-awareness tool. It also would be perfect for counselors 
              to break the ice with a new client. Parents will find it a great 
              tool to get their teen talking about themselves. Genealogists appreciate 
              how it reveals the personalities of their ancestors. </font></b></p>

              analysis with the work removed, and the fun left in. That's why

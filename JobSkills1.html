        <span style="color:#000000;"><br /></span><span style=
        "font-size:15px; color:#000000;">Are you presently out of
        work, or hopping from job to frus-
        <br />
        trating job? Or are you dissatisfied with your present
        position,
        <br />
        hardly able to bear another hour of the daily grind? Still
        search-
        <br />
        ing for your happy niche in life? Then take a close look at
        your
        <br />
        own handwriting and make your dream job a reality!
        <br />
        It truly takes all kinds of people to make up this big,
        beautiful
        <br />
        world, and even in times of high unemployment so much op-
        <br />
        portunity is available. It's a shame so many are caged up
        in an
        <br />
        occupation they don't really want. One of the reasons is
        many
        <br />
        people take jobs because they need them to survive, not
        because
        <br />
        they want them. It's not long before such a person becomes
        a
        <br />
        corporate zombie, a member of the walking dread. He dreads
        <br />
        facing another work day but dreads the thought of being
        laid
        <br />
        off even more.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some feel stuck behind a desk wishing they were out meeting
        <br />
        and mingling with people; others envy the convenient luxury
        of
        <br />
        a sit-down job or the security and seclusion of a tiny
        office, pro-
        <br />
        tected from the extremes of weather. Some yearn to travel.
        <br />
        Others are miserable because they can't put down roots.
        <br />
        The mere thought of changing jobs can be a little
        frightening.
        <br />
        Why should that be if you are considering alternatives for
        your
        <br />
        future happiness? For one thing, current job-hunting advice
        can
        <br />
        make your skin crawl. You can find mountains of information
        <br />
        on resume preparation, interview preparation, test
        preparation.
        <br />
        Warnings emanate from every corner, "Communicate the
        <br />
        proper image! Wear only the proper clothes. Act this way...
        <br />
        don't act that way. Say only the 'right' things, but say
        them only
        <br />
        in the 'right' way!'' One personnel director offered 233
        <br />
        questions for the applicant to practice prior to a hiring
        interview!
        <br />
        <br />
        No wonder you may be a little nervous about returning to
        the
        <br />
        hiring hassle where you are expected to play your
        traditional
        <br />
        role and contribute to the deception game of the job
        interview.
        <br />
        Should you then actively pursue a job which will make your
        <br />
        life happier-a thought probably considered dangerous and
        <br />
        subversive to your spouse, friends, or casual
        acquaintances?
        <br />
        Yes! And vigorously! Here are some suggestions which have
        <br />
        helped many others and can help you, too.
        <br />
        <br />
        Be Honest
        <br />
        Now that you understand the inner workings of the hiring
        <br />
        hassle, it doesn't mean you must continue to be a party to
        the
        <br />
        deception. By being yourself you can feel more relaxed and
        <br />
        confident than ever before. Your honesty will be an asset,
        a
        <br />
        pleasant and conspicuous difference to the interviewer. You
        <br />
        won't have to preprogram yourself to fit some graven image.
        <br />
        Remember that someone needs the unique combinations of
        <br />
        qualities only you possess-that special set of talents,
        traits,
        <br />
        skills, and yes, quirks and defects which exists nowhere
        else on
        <br />
        earth.
        <br />
        <br />
        Realize your value, your true self-worth. Undiscovered for
        <br />
        now, maybe. But priceless nevertheless. When you polish the
        <br />
        jewel that is you with the self-esteem which springs from
        <br />
        self-knowledge, the glare will cause every employer to sit
        up and
        <br />
        take notice. Remember, if you aren't fully convinced of
        your
        <br />
        abilities, how are you going to convince anyone else?
        <br />
        <br /></span><span style=

        Traitmatch Yourself</span><span style=
        "font-size:15px; color:#000000;"><br />
        <br />
        Now get to know yourself through your handwriting, really
        get
        <br />
        to know yourself! Your own analysis will not only help you
        to
        <br />
        verifywhatyou alreadyfeel istrue, itwill helpyou
        discoverother
        <br />
        things about yourself you may never have accepted
        otherwise.
        <br />
        Above all, don't be shy. Acknowledge the qualities you
        find.
        <br />
        Accept them as a part of your occupational personality.
        Humil-
        <br />
        ity, especially with a potential life-long career in the
        balance, is
        <br />
        a foolish virtue. Be proud of your talents! Shout about
        them to
        <br />
        the rooftops if you want!
        <br />
        <br />
        But before you venture boldly out into the job-hunting
        circuit,
        <br />
        be sure your self-portrait is as complete as possible,
        graph-
        <br />
        ologically speaking. Recognize all aspects of yourself
        which
        <br />
        include your limitations as well. Be sure you're honest
        with
        <br />
        yourself. Don't let the idea scare you. If you find some
        changes
        <br />
        may be a good idea in order to enhance your occupational
        <br />
        personality, fine. But you-the you of today-is whom you
        want
        <br />
        to know better. You now have the method within your grasp.
        It's
        <br />
        an ink trail away!

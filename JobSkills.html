        <br />
        "Mechanical" Printing, size, legibility
        <br />
        Printing shows a mechanical mind more concerned with
        "things"
        <br />
        than with people. Large MZH means you prefer large pieces
        of
        <br />
        machinery like computers or bulldozers. Small MZH indicates
        <br />
        interest in small things like watches, parts of machines.
        Legibility
        <br />
        reveals your willingness to do a good job which assures you
        of
        <br />
        success.

        Speed is sometimes hard to detect in writing; i dots and t

        that fall to the right of the stem show quick thinking and

        caused by

        Gettheidea? Delve into your own personality with the

        of self-bias removed. Sincejob happiness resultsfrom
        thefullest
        <br />
        utilization of your uniqueness, you must discover yourself
        first.
        <br />
        If you have any doubts, seek out a professional handwriting
        <br />
        analystwhocan use your handwritingfora thorough evaluation
        <br />
        of your talents and weaknesses. You alone must make the f
        inal
        <br />
        decision, so search for what you really want by a f urther
        step.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Define Your Dream Job
        <br />
        Next, decide what you want to do. What line of work do you
        <br />
        desire? What career do you wish to pursue? You will be
        spend-
        <br />
        ing more time on a job than in any other activity. You
        could
        <br />
        easily say the job is your life, or should be. So much
        energy of
        <br />
        mind and body goes into preparing for it, engaging in it,
        and
        <br />
        relaxing from it. It's a shame if the heart's not in it,
        too. Dis-
        <br />
        covering your own occupational personality prior to seeking
        <br />
        employment gives you greater opportunity for happiness.
        <br />
        Rather than fulfilling some employer's job needs, you'll be
        <br />
        bringing about the fulfillment of your own personal
        desires,
        <br />
        accomplishing your own individual goals.
        <br />
        Before you define your dream job, get rid of certain pre-
        <br />
        conceived notions which are pitfalls to your goal. First,
        forget
        <br />
        about-
        <br />
        What other people want you to be (this includes your
        spouse,
        <br />
        friends, relatives, supervisor or boss);
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font-size:15px; color:#000000;"><br /></span><span style=
        "font-size:15px; color:#000000;">o What you think other
        people want you to be.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        For the moment, also forget all of the old criteria
        normally
        <br />
        used to choose a job. Forget how much the job pays. Your
        goal
        <br />
        is lasting happiness, not a paycheck. If you enjoy what you
        do,
        <br />
        money will not be a primary concern. If you enjoy what you
        do,
        <br />
        you also have much greater chance of success, thereby
        increas-
        <br />
        ing the possibility of better pay!
        <br />
        Forget the promotional opportunities, the benefits, or
        <br />
        prestige. Forget the security the job offers, or where it
        is
        <br />
        located. For the present, don't even consider the
        requirements
        <br />
        necessary to be hired for the job! Now you have a good op-
        <br />
        portunity to discover how you want to spend the rest of
        your life.
        <br />
        <br />
        Concentrate On Your Own Inner Desires
        <br />
        Be free from all of the wrong reasons which motivate most
        <br />
        people; free from the influence of others; free from
        restrictive
        <br />
        job qualifications.
        <br />
        Ask yourself: What do I really WANT to do?
        <br />
        Do you have any secret ambitions? Dwell on them. Become
        <br />
        deliciously absorbed in your dream. Interested in spending
        more
        <br />
        time with your hobby? Often, people desire to do something
        they
        <br />
        already know a little about. Consider job openings in
        fields
        <br />
        related to your hobby, or maybe being in business for
        yourself.
        <br />
        Don't be side-tracked by costs. Continue to explore your
        mind
        <br />
        for your real interests. What were the tasks you enjoyed
        most
        <br />
        in previous positions? What jobs did you like best? What
        were
        <br />
        your favorite school subjects? Scholastic interests can be
        related
        <br />
        to many occupations.
        <br />
        If you can't narrow your choices down to a particular job,
        don't
        <br />
        worry. Choose several alternatives for now. As you proceed
        to
        <br />
        traitmatch yourself into your dream job, your job goal will
        <br />
        become more clearly defined.
        <br />
        You might find it helpful to look through the Occupational
        <br />
        Outlook Handbook (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
        <br />
        Statistics, Bulletin 1700). It lists over 800 different
        occupations;
        <br />
        everything from applying the candy coating on medical pills
        to
        <br />
        uranium mining.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Determine the Cost and Your Willingness to Pay
        <br />
        Evaluate your dream job in light of the personality traits
        found
        <br />
        in your handwriting analysis. It would be ideal, of course,
        if the
        <br />
        match was exact. If so, you are probably already occupied
        in
        <br />
        your dream job. It's more likely that there are reasons why
        they
        <br />
        don't match. Everything has a price, and the differences
        which
        <br />
        exist between your dream job and your occupational
        personality
        <br />
        is the price you must be willing to pay to make your dream
        a
        <br />
        reality.
        <br />
        Do you want to be president of a firm? A commendable desire
        <br />
        if your handwriting revealed that you thrive on heavy
        responsi-
        <br />
        bility; enjoy weighty decision-making; constant diplomacy;
        <br />
        intense physical and mental exertion, and have an almost
        <br />
        obsessive ambition. Otherwise, you are not being completely
        <br />
        honest with yourself.
        <br />
        If your family always wanted you to enter the convent, but
        <br />
        you've always had a secret yen for belly-dancing, and if
        your
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        handwriting backs up your hidden ambition with traits like
        <br />
        rhythm, artistic talent, showmanship and a strong physical
        and
        <br />
        sensual drive, you'd be better off to put a jewel in your
        navel
        <br />
        than a habit on your head.
        <br />
        Do you find you love the outdoors? Turn in your key to the
        <br />
        executive washroom and become a lumberjack-or postman-or
        <br />
        football coach, if that's what will make you happy. It's
        your life.
        <br />
        Live it!
        <br />
        This doesn't mean rushing out and quitting the job you have
        <br />
        now, unless you can afford it. Use your present job as a
        survival
        <br />
        cushion while you prepare for your dream job. The cost of
        your
        <br />
        dream job may be in time and patience; in more education
        <br />
        through evening classes or correspondence courses; in
        making
        <br />
        the appropriate contacts who can help you find the job you
        seek.
        <br />
        You will have a clearer picture of your goals and your
        <br />
        ability to achieve them by:
        <br />
        A. Honesty
        <br />
        B. Evaluating your personality through Traitmatch
        <br />
        C. Defining your dream job
        <br />
        D. Determining the cost and your willingness to pay
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Remember, there's no one better qual if ied to make you
        happy
        <br />
        than you. Why spend the only life you'll ever have in a job
        that
        <br />
        doesn't stimulate you and make you eager to start a new
        day?
        <br />
        Follow your star! But before you hitch your wagon up, take
        a
        <br />
        good look at what's inside it. Most important of all,
        remember
        <br />
        that you'll be happiest in a job which utilizes the full
        potential
        <br />
        of your occupational personality. The uniqueness that is
        you.

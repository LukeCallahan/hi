        proceed as follows.</span><span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;"><br />

        <br />
        1. if you do not already have a writing sample, give the
        person a sheet of unlined paper and a pen and ask them to
        write a few sentences and then sign their name. It they
        give you a blank stare, then suggest that they write
        something like "Here is a sample of my handwriting. Please
        tell me what my handwriting says about my personality."
        followed by their signature.
        <br />
        <br />
        2.</span> <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">
        <em>Take a moment to look at the writing and see how
        similar the writing is to the
        signature</em></span><span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">.
        Remember from</span> <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">
        <a href="basicconcepts.htm"
           rel="external"
           title="Basic Concepts">Basic Concepts</a></span>

        signature</span> <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">
        represents the public image that the writer wants to
        project. Therefore, a big difference between a person's
        writing and their signature indicates a big difference
        between their private and public self. When the writing and
        the signature are identical, then "what you see is what you
        get" and the person presents themself identical to how they
        feel inside.
        <br />
        <br />
        3.</span> <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">
        <em>Also, note if the writing slants to the
        left</em></span><span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">.
        I have found that when their is a left slant to the
        writing, indicating the writer is less spontaneous and more
        self-conscious, that they will be less likely to engage in
        an open conversation with you about what their handwriting
        reveals.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Pull out your Handwriting Insights Deck.</span>
        <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">
        With the person's involvement</span><span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">,
        go through each of the 11 categories (e.g. SIze, Slant,
        etc.) and pull to one side the card that most closely
        matches. If you are not sure, just skip the category. If
        you feel that two cards match (this often happens with
        Connections, for example) then pull to one side both cards.
        Then explain to the person that each writing characteristic
        is an aspect of their personality and that it is all of
        them combined together that create the personality.
        Then</span> <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">
        turn the Handwriting Insights deck over and hand it to the
        person.</span> <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">
        (I have found that this makes people more comfortable
        because they get to see it directly instead of you telling
        it to them.
        <br />
        <br />
        5. From there, they may just start talking or you can ask
        them what they agree and disagree with. Listen an learn how
        this person sees themself.
        <br />
        <br />
        6. If I know the person personally (as opposed to when I
        analyze the handwriting of relative strangers at parties)
        it isn't unusual for me to be surprised about a couple of
        the handwriting characteristics. For example, once I noted
        that the writer used very large capital letters (indicating
        he wanted attention) and yet I knew this fellow to be very
        quiet and shy. So I said, that really surprises me that
        your capitals are so large which indicate you want to be
        noticed and he replied "yes - I noticed that a lot of
        executives wrote that way so I decided to copy that style
        thinking it might help me get ahead." That's the kind of
        interesting insights you will get when you talk with people
        about their handwriting.

        <br /></span><span style=

        </span><span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">It
        is useful for you to keep in mind</span> <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">
        that most people are self critical, and that we live in a
        world that keeps telling us we need to improve - be thinner
        or more educated or richer or whatever. My goal in creating
        Handwriting Insights was to give a descriptive,
        nonjudgmental profile so that the person would get insight
        without any hurt feelings. For example, writers with tiny
        writing are described as "pays attention to detail" and not
        as "picky." Often when I analyze the writing of children in
        their early teans they will ask "is that bad" and I always
        reply that</span> <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">
        there are no bad cards.</span> <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">
        So this interaction with you gives the person the
        opportunity to talk about how they see themself in less of
        a judgmental way.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each personality profile an opportunity to help people
        appreciate who they are, get to know them better.
        <br />
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">If
        you find the writing is significantly different from the
        handwriting,</span> <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">
        you can use a phrasing like "you present yourself as
        -----------------, but inside you feel --------------." So
        for example if someones' signature is large, but their
        writing is very small, you could say "You present yourself
        as standing out in a crowd and enjoying attention, but
        inside you feel more introspective and are not seeking
        attention."
        <br />
        <br />
        My favorite part of profiling someone's personality is when
        I find that I have made a wrong assumption about someone
        and in getting that corrected I learn something I would
        have not otherwise learned about the person. For example, I
        was analyzing my friend's mother of 75 years old, a lovely,
        quiet, reserved southern woman. When I got to her capitals
        they were HUGE (this means that she likes attention) and I
        thought - this can't be right! So instead of pulling aside
        the Large card for Capitals, I pulled aside the medium
        card. After looking at the cards I had selected she said
        that she agreed with all of them but the medium capitals
        card - she said "Oh no, that is wrong. I LOVE attention."
        My lesson - just look at the writing and select the cards
        and let the person tell you what they believe.
        <br />
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">Sometimes
        the handwriting sample will be written with jerkey strokes,
        broken lines, uneven pressure, overall erratic.</span>
        <span style=
        "font:13px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">
        This can be a sign of significant health problems in the
        writer, and if you get a chance to look at the writer when
        they are writing the sample you will see the difficulties
        that they are having controlling the pen. When this
        happens, since you are just an amateur handwriting analyst
        doing this for fun and insight, what I suggest you do is to
        simply say that the writer is not feeling energetic right
        now, and focus on the writing characteristics that are not
        too impacted by the difficulty of writing. I was handed a
        sample like this once by a middle aged woman and for a
        moment it took my breath away as it seemed to weak and
        shakey and my overall impression was that she was quite ill
        (it turned out that she was in the final stages of a life
        threatening disease). So I focused on slant, capitals,
        size, and zones and said some encouraging words about what
        a people person she was. I skipped totally baseline and
        rhythm. In that way I could create a personality profile
        without talking about health issues.

        Handwriting Insights explains eleven different handwriting
        traits. Each trait has three to ten variations. For
        example, the trait of Slant, which represents a person's
        emotional interactions, has the following six variations:
        strong right, right, vertical, left, strong left, and
        varied. On the front of each card is an example of that
        particular variation, and a description of what to look for
        in the writing.

        <span style=
        "font:16px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#000000;">
        On the back of the card is both a brief and a more detailed
        explanation of what that particular writing trait means.
        These explanation are descriptive, not judgmental. This
        means that people will get insight into what their
        handwriting is saying about their personalities without
        getting their feeling hurt.
        <br />
        Producing an analysis is a simple as going through the
        deck, seeing which of the variations most matches the
        writing for each of the eleven traits, and sliding the
        matching card to the side. You wind up with eleven cards,
        and when you turn the deck over, there is the
        analysis.</span> <span style=

        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif;"><br />
        &nbsp; Printing is both the oldest and the newest of
        communication types. Since Wilhelm Preyer,(1895) a
        professor of physiology at Jena, Switzerland, formulated
        and proved the concept of writing as "brain writing",
        various writing styles have intrigued graphologists.
        Knowing that the brain develops an image, that nerve
        impulses impart that image to the writing field, it is
        easier to understand that even "mouth writing" and "foot
        writing" are legitimate methods of expressive movement. If
        all writing originates in the brain no matter what writing
        instrument or surface is utilized, surely printing is brain
        writing too. Why do graphologist's veer away from analyzing
        printing? What makes it different? How does the sincere
        analyst deal with printing?
        <br />
        &nbsp;
        <br />
        &nbsp; One graphologist who has often invited guest
        speakers to his group asks them what they do when
        confronted with a printing? The answer usually is: "I ask
        for another sample, cursively written." Even now when a
        student,asks how to analyze printing, too many teachers
        say: "Do the best you can." This quibbling is no longer
        necessary.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=

        &nbsp; allude to printing, but none give
        practical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruction
        on how to
        <br />
        &nbsp; analyze it.
        <br />
        When the ball point pen appeared on the market, some
        graphologists claimed the science was doomed because they
        couldn't analyze pressure without the broad strokes of the
        nib pen. A few even gave up the practice of handwriting
        analysis because of this. Eventually most analysts learned
        to cope with the new writing tool. I believe we can cope
        with printing as well. &nbsp;
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps an understanding of what
        has gone before will throw&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light on the subject.

        Writing Through The Ages
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Although printing has come into common use in America only
        in the past fifty years, the basic style was actually one
        of the first communication modes. Pictograms on cave walls
        began as strokes scratched on the earthen surface.
        Hieroglyphics were the sacred signs of the Egyptians. But
        about 3500 B.C. a style of writing was developed in the
        orient called "cuniform," meaning roughly, "wedge shape."
        As a practical method of writing, it not only was popular
        in the country of its origin, but was adopted by Sumerians,
        Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites, Persians and by others in
        areas of the far east. At that time the "pen" was a reed or
        wooden stick, fashioned to imprint wedge shaped grooves on
        clay or wax. Skilled writers handled the rather awkward
        "pen and paper" to create lines of different widths. Some
        writing was pictorial in content, other writings were
        symbolic vertical lines (masculine) and triangular wedges
        (feminine). From this humble beginning our alphabet
        evolved. Some modern scholars call cuniform writing the
        "Roman letters" of the ancient orient.

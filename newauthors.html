      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Around 20 years ago I won a 
        handwriting analysis at one of those charity autions. When I met with 
        the professional graphologist she agreed to look at five handwriting samples 
        and give me a few minute description of each person. She told me things 
        that were so accurate that it could not be just a coincidence. And she 
        told me additional things that I did not know about these people, that 
        I later found out to be true! When I asked the grraphologist what in the 
        handwriting told here these things, she made it quite clear to me that 
        telling me that was not part of the analyses and I would have to read 
        books and take courses to learn this skill (you know, sort of like magicians 
        will rarely tell you how a trick is done)</font>.</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So off I went, reading scores 
        of books and taking four coorespondence courses, learning all that I could 
        about handwriting analysis. During this time at work I transferred to 
        a new job and became an ombudsperson, a person who meets with people to 
        help them resolve issues that they may have at work. I found that my handwriting 
        skills were helpful in better understanding my clients. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Right about now I need to let 
        you know that I do not have that great a memory, so that remembering what 
        all these writing traits meant was getting to be quite a bother. I worked 
        to develop a simple tool for myself using the handwriting traits that 
        I found were most useful. I found that the 11 traits that are in the free 
        course form a solid foundation for a basic understanding of a person's 
        personality. I worded the interpretation of these traits in a way that 
        was descriptive and not judgmental, so that people would be more willing 
        to accept and make use of what they may learn.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have helped so many people 
        better understand themselves and their others by looking at their handwriting, 
        that I wanted to make this simple skill more broadly available. So I developed 
        and was granted a patent on Handwriting Insights, and I am marketing it 
        here. I hope that you find it useful!</font></p>

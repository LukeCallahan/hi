        In the last fifty years printing has become an accepted
        form of written communication. To an analyst this poses a
        perplexing problem because the use of mechanical printing
        puts a mask over personality which hides the emotional
        feelings of the writer. Printing uses a majority of strokes
        which are downstrokes. Cursive writing combines both
        upstrokes of conscious upslant and unconscious downslant.
        So printing tends to disguise the feelings and make them a
        product of unconscious motivation rather than of conscious
        will. The writer who prints exclusively (except for perhaps
        his signature) often is hiding his true nature, possibly
        even from himself. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br /></span><span style=

        OF PRINTING</span> <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#010101;"><br />

        &nbsp;
        <br />
        What most people refer to as printing sometimes is really a
        combination of both printing and cursive script. This
        combination sometimes indicates ingenuity and good problem
        solving abilities on the part of the writer. The analyst
        needs to recognize what printing or cursive writing is used
        and also the picture values within the sample before making
        this evaluation.
        <br />
        &nbsp;
        <br />
        The writer who prints is basically one who is a
        constructive and practical thinker who relates to the
        mechanics and material/ tangible aspects of life. Printing
        provides a cover up for his true feelings. Harmonious
        printing indicates a person who thinks in a building block
        fashion. He is able to take many small details and combine
        them into a coordinated whole. He possesses self control
        and good organizational abilities. Inharmonious printing
        indicates a person who is fragmented in his thinking and
        has difficulty relating to others. He can be sharp and
        unfeeling in social interactions.

        OF PRINTING</span> <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#010101;"><br />

        &nbsp;
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; font-weight:bold; color:#010101;font-weight:bold;">MANUSCRIPT
        (also called PRINTSCRIPT)</span> <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#010101;">is
        the "copybook" style of printing, used normally in
        newspapers and books.</span> <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; font-weight:bold; color:#010101;font-weight:bold;">
        It uses all three zones and can be analyzed with the same
        general rules that apply to cursive writing. Although the
        letters may be disconnected, there is a fluid movement from
        letter to letter that contributes to its score for
        connectedness which is covered in the last part of this
        lesson.</span> <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#010101;">This
        easy movement from letter to letter is in contrast to block
        printing (see below) and gives the printer an opportunity
        to exhibit personal originality and still remain legible.
        &nbsp;
        <br />
        Interpretation of a pure printscript form shows the
        conservative, conventional personality. This writer is
        geared more toward logic, mechanics and material "things"
        than toward people. People who print legibly are usually
        intelligent and objective.

        PRINTING</span> <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#010101;">uses
        downstrokes almost exclusively. This style insures
        legibility and clarity of form. However, there are no lower
        zone strokes to measure which poses a problem to the
        analyst. To discover relative zonal size, check the letters
        A and H (and others) and measure the distance from the
        crossbar to the baseline- to determine middle zone size.
        The distance from the cross bar to the top of the letter
        will give you a good idea of upper zone extension, but you
        will have to "guesstimate" what the lower zone might be
        from your experience with cursive writing and its zonal
        balance. This comes with practice.
        <br />
        <br />
        The block printer is one who sees structure in everything
        around him. Often the adult who block prints is required to
        do so by his career as a draftsperson, a builder, an
        architect, computer worker, etc. He is a literal person and
        must see an object work or handle it before he thoroughly
        understands its function. He prefers to work with his
        hands. &nbsp;
        <br />
        His feelings are usually masked and may be deep and basic.
        It may be difficult for him to express himself verbally. By
        printing, he uses a facade to protect his emotional
        nature.</span><span style=

        PRINTING</span> <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#010101;">is
        a combination of printed and cursive letters. Picture value
        is reflected in curved, flowing flourishes and original
        letter forms which give an artistic, pleasing picture to
        the eye. There may be exaggerations of line values
        throughout adding to the creative artistry. occasionally it
        is possible to recognize what form of art this printer
        expresses by the color (shading and pressure), musical
        forms or sculptured structure of the letters.
        <br />
        &nbsp; An artistic printer has strong emotional
        expressiveness, but may not show this by his actions.
        Instead he expresses his versatility through his creative
        work. The printing is the protective facade of his personal
        emotions. The shading and pressure (color) are the artistic
        uniqueness.

        BUSINESS PRINTING</span> <span style=
        "font:16px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; color:#010101;">is
        usually block printing or a structured style of manuscript.
        It has less flow and less picture value because the
        emphasis is on legibility for the purpose of clarity in the
        business. As a non-emotional style of communication, it is
        becoming more universal as society becomes more geared to
        machines.</span><span style=

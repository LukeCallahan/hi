        Are you interested in handwriting analysis and want to go
        further? There are lots of options available to you: free
        on-line analysis, correspondence courses, good books,
        hiring a professional graphologist. You can spend anywhere
        from nothing at all to quite a bit, both in time and in
        money.
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />
        </span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">Let's
        look at this from from four different perspectives:
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />
        </span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">1.
        How much money are you willing to spend?</span>
        <span style="font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        Books and kits run under $20.00, courses can go up to
        $1000.00 each, professional graphologists charge anywhere
        from $50.00 to $200.00 and more for a single analysis.
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />
        </span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">Do
        you see this as a money making venture?</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        If you see this as a money making venture, here is my two
        cents on that. There are definitely some people out there
        who are earning good money doing handwriting analyses. But
        I get the impression by looking at many websites of
        certified graphologist, by talking with certified
        graphologists, and by looking at EBAY offerings to analyze
        handwriting, that getting customers is not an easy task. It
        is just something to think about before you plunk down your
        money. Do a search on translation jobs and thousands of
        jobs come up on Google. Do a search on Handwriting Analysis
        jobs and you will get zilch.
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />
        </span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">Several
        people who have taken these expensive handwriting
        certification courses have contacted me asking if I could
        help them to get customers as they are having trouble
        attracting business.
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />
        </span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">2.
        How much time do you want to spend?</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        To become a professional graphologist takes years of study
        and can run thousands of dollars. And after you are
        certified it requires you to continue your studies and use
        your skills regularly so that they don't become stale.
        Calling a professional graphologist for a personality
        profile report whenever you need one takes very little
        time. Books take time to read, plus you need to use what
        you have learned to retain it. Handwriting Insights 5
        Minute Handwriting Analysis Kit takes 15 minutes to learn,
        and from then on 5 minutes to create a personality profile.
        Obviously I am biased since I developed Handwriting
        Insights, but you might want to try it first and then
        improve your skills with a few good books on analyzing
        handwriting.
        <br />
        <br /></span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        3. Do you want to acquire a new skill?</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        Handwriting Analysis is a wonderful skill to possess. There
        will be lots of instances where you see someone's writing
        and having this skill will let you analyze it on the spot!
        Having the skill means that you directly look at the
        writing and using your memory (and maybe with the help of a
        tool like Handwriting Insights and/or a good book on
        handwriting analysis, or your notes) you can create a
        personality profile. It means that your eyes and your brain
        are producing the results, as opposed to a computer program
        or a professional graphologist.
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />
        </span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">4.
        How important is it that the result be thorough and
        accurate?</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        If you are mainly interested in analyzing handwriting so
        that you can create a personality profile at parties, or
        use it as conversation starters, or use it as an icebreaker
        game, then it is fine to just look at, for example, the 11
        basic handwriting indicators in Handwriting Insights. If
        you will be doing this as a professional, then obviously
        your results must be accurate if you wish to have a viable
        business. And when you use a professional graphologist you
        expect their result to be comprehensive.
        <br />
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />
        </span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">Let's
        look at some combinations of the four items above.
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />
        </span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">1.
        Sometime nothing but a professional will do, because there
        is no room for error and you want someone who is very
        experienced in analyzing handwriting, and you need the
        analysis NOW.
        <br /></span><span style=
        "font:16px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><br />
        </span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">Hire
        an experienced, certified Handwriting Analyst -</span>
        <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        It is amazing what a really good handwriting analyst can
        see in handwriting. Paula Sassi (</span><span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;"><a href="mailto:hci@hotmail.com"
           rel="self">hci@hotmail.com</a></span><span style=
           "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">),
           a certified graphologist who is technical consultant to
           Handwriting Insights, looks at dozens of writing samples
           a day. Her home is filled with graphology books,
           manuscript books, and interesting antique writing
           samples - from autograph books to old hotel registers.
           She regularly gives talks on handwriting, and is a
           consultant to many companies. When you have a writing
           sample that you want analyzed where there is no room for
           error, then it is best to have a professional like Paula
           analyze it. Let's say for example that you are to be
           married, and you and your fiancé are having some
           problems and you want some in-depth understand of your
           fiance' personality. A professional graphologist can
           provide that!</span> <span style=
           "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        Pros:</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        The quality of the analysis is much higher when you get it
        from an experienced professional. This will give you more
        information and more confidence in the accuracy.</span>
        <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        Cons:</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        This is costly ($75 or more for an analysis), so for most
        people this will be done rarely.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br /></span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        2. You'd like to learn the basics; it would be fun at
        parties and useful in understanding people better and
        create a personality profile, but if you make a mistake
        it's no big deal. You do not want to invest a lot of time
        or money. You do not want to spend a lot of time retaining
        this knowledge (i.e. a tool that keeps the information at
        your fingertips would be good). You would like not to
        depend on the computer to generate a report.

        -</span> <span style=

        Handwriting Insights is a high quality deck of 64
        connected, illustrated cards that teaches you handwriting
        analysis as you use it. You'll have your first analysis 15
        minutes after you open the package. After the first time,
        analyzing a hand writing sample just takes 5 minutes. It is
        designed to provide feedback that is descriptive, not
        judgmental. It is the easiest way to produce a basic
        handwriting analysis.</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        Pros:</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        low cost ($10.95), low one-time investment, little to
        remember, no hurt feeling with analysis results, fast, the
        more often you use it the more you will remember what the
        different traits mean, thereby training your eyes to
        analyze handwriting without the deck. A written report
        personality profile is easily generated using the
        Individual Insights pad that comes in the kit. You can hand
        the deck with the selected cards to the person whose
        writing you are analyzing and they can read the meaning
        themselves, thereby not having to take your word for what
        the writing traits mean. Easy to use when you only do
        occasional handwriting analyses.</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        Cons:</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        only provides a basic analysis, there are many hand writing
        traits that are not included. Supplementing Handwriting
        Insights will a good book like Ruiz's Basic Handwriting
        Analysis is a good idea when you want more detail.

        There are several of good books to select from to learn
        handwriting analysis. They have lots of examples, and after
        reading them and learning the material, you will be able to
        do a handwriting analysis.</span> <span style=

        Pros:</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        Books are not expensive, lots of examples, lots of details
        and writing traits to look at.</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        Cons:</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        You need to read a book and remember what it is teaching
        you. If you only analyze handwritings periodically, it is
        easy to forgot. There is not easy way to generate a written
        report. When you talk to people about what their
        handwriting means, it is easy for them not to believe you
        because you are just saying it (as opposed to showing them,
        for example, the cards in Handwriting Insights). Some books
        are lot better than others. Many are overwhelming in their
        complexity.

        a Handwriting Analysis Course -</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        Typically handwriting analysis courses from professional
        organizations are well written, present lots of useful
        information and examples, and interacting one on one with
        the instructor who was a certified handwriting analyst is
        valuable.</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        Pros:</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        Provides more structure than books, you get to interact
        with an instructor, provides an opportunity for working
        towards certification as a handwriting analyst.</span>
        <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        Cons:</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        If you are not interested in certification and baring money
        doing handwriting analysis, then this could be overkill.
        Courses can cost lots of money, and take time. Once you
        acquire the knowledge, you need to keep using it or you
        will forget it.
        <br /></span><span style=

        You don't want to learn handwriting analysis at all - you
        just want some personality profiles from some writing
        samples and autographs that you have. These reports do not
        have to be in-depth.
        <br /></span><span style=

        -</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        There are lots of on-line sites where you can get a free,
        computer generated handwriting analysis. You look at your
        writing sample, and then answer questions about it. After
        you are done a report comes up on the screen, or a report
        is emailed to you.</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        Pros:</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        It's free, you don't need to learn or remember
        anything.</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#030303;font-weight:bold;">
        Cons:</span> <span style=
        "font:18px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#030303;">
        You don't acquire any skills yourself, so that when you see
        a writing sample you cannot make an immediate analysis -
        you need either a copy of it (which is not usually
        available) or to remember what the writing looks like and
        then go on-line later and generate an analysis. In other
        words, you are tied to a computer for your analyses. Some
        of the reports could have traits described using negative
        terms that can result in hurt feelings.
